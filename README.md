# icmpc-escom-2021-programme

Creating a CSV version of ICMPC-ESCOM 2021 programme with datetime objects.

### PROGRAMME.pdf

The PDF is the original version provided by conference organizers. 

### PROGRAMME.xlsx

The excel document was autogenerated using Adobe's online PDF->excel tool. 

### ICMPC-ESCOM-2021-Programme.csv

This CSV file is a (slightly) cleaned up version of the talk schedule.

### ICMPC-ESCOM-2021-Programme-Datetime.csv

This CSV file uses the script add_timezones.R to add datetime columns for UTC and America/Toronto. It also fixes the odd choice in the original programme to list talks at 23:00 hours as happening on the subsequent day (e.g., talks at time "23 (Weds)" were listed on the page for Thursday).

### add_timezones.R

Edit this script to add your time zone and generate local times.
